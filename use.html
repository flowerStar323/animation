            <p class="text">The Company may update this contact information from time to time without notice to you. We will post the current contact information on this Site.</p>
            <p class="text bold">Survival of Terms After Agreement Ends</p>
            <p class="text">Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms of Use, or any general legal principles to the contrary, any provision of these Terms of Use that imposes or contemplates continuing obligations on a party will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms of Use.</p>
            <p class="text bold">Force Majeure</p>
            <p class="text">The Company shall be excused from performance under these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase, to the extent it is prevented from or delayed from performing, in whole or in part, as a result of an event or series of events caused by or resulting from (1) weather conditions or other elements of nature or acts of God, (2) acts of war, acts of terrorism, insurrection, riots, civil disorders or rebellion, (3) quarantines or embargoes, (4) labor strikes, or (5) other causes beyond the reasonable control of the Company.</p>
            <p class="text">Risk of Loss</p>
            <p class="text">The items purchased through the Site are shipped by a third party carrier pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.</p>
            <p class="text bold">General</p>
            <p class="text">If any of the provisions set forth in these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase are deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the unenforceable condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions of these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such section. These Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase and the relationship between you and the Company will be governed by the laws of the United States, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. For any actions not subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court located in the United States.</p>
            <p class="text">The failure of the Company to act with respect to a breach of these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase by you or others does not waive the Company’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. If any content on this Site, or your use of the Site, is contrary to the laws of the place where you are when you access it, the Site is not intended for you, and we ask you not to use the Site. You are responsible for informing yourself of the laws of your jurisdiction and complying with them.</p>
            <p class="text">The Company does not guarantee it will take action against all breaches of these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase. Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase.</p>
            <p class="text bold">Changes to These Terms of Use</p>
            <p class="text">You acknowledge and agree that the Company may, in its sole discretion, modify, add or remove any portion of these Terms of Use at any time and in any manner, by posting revised Terms of Use on the Site. You may not amend or modify these Terms of Use under any circumstances. It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we make to the Terms of Use. Your continued use of this Site after any changes to the Terms of Use means you accept the changes.</p>
            <p class="text bold">Assignment</p>
            <p class="text">You may not assign these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase (or any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder) by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the Company, which may be withheld at the Company’s sole discretion. Any attempted assignment that does not comply with these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase shall be null and void. The Company may assign these Terms of Use or the Terms of Purchase, in whole or in part, to any third party in its sole discretion.</p>
            <p class="text bold">Entire Agreement and Admissibility</p>
            <p class="text">These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and the Company with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms of Use apply solely to the extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p class="text">In some instances, both of these Terms of Use and a separate document that provides additional conditions may apply to a service or product offered via this Site (“Additional Terms”). To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.</p>
            <p class="text">A printed version of these Terms of Use shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based on or relating to use of this site to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p>
